# My-Portfolio-Site
This is my personal portfolio site. It outlines my career, my skills and my past work. Managers, recruiters, developers, and other professionals are welcome to visit my site to get a taste of my web development skills. It also features a link to my Gitbhub and as well as a section to allow visitors to e-mail me.

All of the UI elements rely on the HTML and CSS. I will add some Javascript later.
